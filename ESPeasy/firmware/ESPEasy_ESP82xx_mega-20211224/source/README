The scripts in this directory are so called GIT hooks.
Purpose is to do automatic changes after merge, commit and checkout.

Those files are for a Linux-like environment with basic tools ln, grep, sed and bash.

Windows users can see them as template.

To use them simply copy those files into your ESPEasy/.git/hooks directory.
